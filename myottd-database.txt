The database used is PostgreSQL. It needs a solid database engine that can handle concurrency properly, support for
transactions etc. The various daemons will each use the database (as their own user - split security around by views, e.g. most daemons don't need to see the password hashes or email addresses in the users table).

The database is used to store historical or "important" data. Things like server status MUST NOT be stored in the database - status will be queried explicitly over XMLRPC, and must not be pushed to the database every time the status changes. Status changes may be logged if needed, but the current status will not be feteched from the database.
